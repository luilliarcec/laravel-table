The purpose of this package is to save time on filter and table design. Although there are similar packages, they add
too much complexity or are tied to a frontend stack like Livewire or Inertiajs. However, this package is designed to be
easy to use without the need for an additional stack.

Its operation is simple, it takes the query of your request by adding your new queries to said query and synchronously
filtering by making http requests.

It should be noted that all filters will be grouped into an array called filters. On the other hand, the columns are
grouped in a matrix called columns, in this way, the package is prepared to work perfectly with Spatie's package,
laravel-query-builder.

```bash
composer require luilliarcec/laravel-table
